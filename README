This is a Space Invaders clone I made in collaboration with Dr. Steve Zdancewic
from the University of Pennsylvania. Steve wrote the graphics display (i.e.
managing the JFrame, etc. in Game.java), and some " skeleton" parts in the rest
of the project (for example, collision detection and picture retrieval), while
I did the rest. If you want to know who is responsible for a specific part of the
code, just ask me.
